            <h1>PROLOGUE</h1>
            <p>The player character <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #57c8e8;">V</span>, is contracted along with Jackie Welles, to steal an important piece of technology from the Arasaka Corporation - know as the chip of immortality - by fixer Dexter Deshawn. The duo manage to infiltrate the megacorp and steal the device but the plan goes awry and Jackie appears to die. After meeting with Dexter, V is betrayed and left for dead in a landfill, but manages to survive - possibly in-part due to the chip of immortality - and is haunted by the digital-ghost of iconic Rockerboy, Johnny Silverhand.</p>
